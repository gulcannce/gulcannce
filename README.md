# 👋 Hi, I’m Gulcan  

## 🌟 About Me  
I’m passionate about **Software Testing and Quality Assurance** — breaking things is actually my favorite superpower   
🌱 Currently diving into the world of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with great excitement 🤖✨  
 **Creativity + Logic = **  
That’s why I love collaborating on **AI & Testing projects**.  
📜 **ISTQB Certified Test Specialist**  
(Quality for me is not just a goal, but a standard ✔️)  
⚡ Fun fact: Coffee + Code + Test  = Happy Me   
Pronouns: **She/Her**  (but actually a proud “Bug Hunter” )
